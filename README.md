## Phylogenetic analysis of Morpho genus
This project runs on an R script which analyses the Morpho genus using the COI-5P gene. The data for the study was obtained from the BOLD. 
The project yields three graphical representation of the phylogenetic analysis: 
1. Phylogenetic tree showing branch distance using colour
2. Heatmap
3. Phylogenetic tree with section of MSA beside species
